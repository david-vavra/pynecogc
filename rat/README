This directory contains auxiliary configuration files (contexts, fields)
that RAT needs for its function and they form so-called configuration type.
They are to be placed into directory that have been chosen during installation
of RAT (/usr/etc/configs by default).

A user needs to choose one of the configuration types along with the rulebase.
So for example:

ncat -t cisco-uvt -r sw.company.com.rules sw.company.com
